	<h1>Learning: A Journey Continued</h1>
	<p>Those who think learning happens in school is mistaken. A good chunk of learning happens outside the classroom</p>
	<p>This website is to help with learning new tools and topics.</p>
	<p>Everything I want to learn will include posts, links, and images explaining what I have learned<p>
