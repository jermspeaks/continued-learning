<h1 id="what-the-glob">What the glob?</h1>

<p>I ran across the <a href="https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob">node-glob</a> and realized I didn&#39;t know what a glob is. I read through the node-glob documentation and found out globs are a form of pattern matching. I realized I had been using globs for a long time, like the wildcard notation, without knowing its name.</p>

<h2 id="wildcards">Wildcards</h2>

<p>There are generally two wildcards you can use for glob functions. </p>

<ol>
<li><code>*</code> - &quot;any string of characters&quot;</li>
<li><code>?</code> - one character</li>
</ol>

<p>There are also brackets, where the character must be one of the following, or given as a range.</p>

<ol>
<li><code>[abc]</code> - one of &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, or &quot;c&quot;</li>
<li><code>[a-z]</code> - between the range of &quot;a&quot; to &quot;z&quot;.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can also line this up with a &quot;!&quot; to mean not in the following bracket.</p>

<ol>
<li><code>[!abc]</code> - not one of &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, or &quot;c&quot;</li>
<li><code>[!a-z]</code> - not in the range of &quot;a&quot; to &quot;z&quot;</li>
</ol>

<p>The examples above are used in UNIX-based systems. These commands are slightly different in Window&#39;s Powershell and SQL. For more information about those systems, you can read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)">the Wikipedia article</a> about globs. </p>
