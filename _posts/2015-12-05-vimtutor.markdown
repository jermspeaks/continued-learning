  A   type appended text   <ESC>    append after the line

NOTE: Pressing <ESC> will place you in Normal mode or will cancel an unwanted and partially completed command.

## Lesson 2 Summary

2. To delete from the cursor to the end of a line type:    d$
3. To delete a whole line type:    dd
4. To repeat a motion prepend it with a number:   2w
5. The format for a change command is:
  operator   [number]   motion
  where:
    operator - is what to do, such as  d  for delete
    [number] - is an optional count to repeat the motion
    motion   - moves over the text to operate on, such as  w (word), (to the end of line), etc.
6. To move to the start of the line use a zero:  0
7. To undo previous actions, type:            u  (lowercase u)
    To undo all the changes on a line, type:  U  (capital U)
    To undo the undo's, type:                 CTRL-R

## Lesson 3 Summary


  1. To put back text that has just been deleted, type   p .  This puts the
     deleted text AFTER the cursor (if a line was deleted it will go on the
     line below the cursor).

  2. To replace the character under the cursor, type   r   and then the
     character you want to have there.

  3. The change operator allows you to change from the cursor to where the
     motion takes you.  eg. Type  ce  to change from the cursor to the end of
     the word,  c$  to change to the end of a line.

  4. The format for change is:

         c   [number]   motion
