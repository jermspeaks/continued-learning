# Continued Learning

## Topic

Topics I am currently learning, going to learn in the future, and topics I've learned in the past. 

The [topic list](./topics/index.md).

For each topic, I want to do the following:

* Define the topic
* Summarize the topic in my own words
* Add resources
* Create a code sample, if necessary
* Blog about it
  * [Write an post on codepen](http://codepen.io/write/)
